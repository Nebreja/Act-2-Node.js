        <h2>What is Node.js?</h2>
        
        <section>
            <p><strong>Node.js</strong> is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It enables developers to build scalable and high-performance server-side applications using JavaScript.</p>
            <p>Here are some key features and benefits of Node.js:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Non-blocking I/O:</strong> Node.js uses asynchronous, event-driven I/O operations, allowing it to handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking the execution of code.</li>
                <li><strong>Single-threaded Model:</strong> Although it uses a single thread for event handling, Node.js can handle numerous connections simultaneously due to its non-blocking architecture.</li>
                <li><strong>Fast Execution:</strong> Built on the V8 engine, Node.js compiles JavaScript to machine code for fast execution.</li>
                <li><strong>Rich Ecosystem:</strong> Node.js has a large ecosystem of open-source libraries and modules available via npm (Node Package Manager), making it easier to add functionality to applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Full-stack JavaScript:</strong> With Node.js, developers can use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side programming, enabling a more unified development experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Node.js is commonly used for building web servers, APIs, real-time applications, and more, making it a versatile tool for modern web development.</p>
